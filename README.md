- 👋 Hi, I’m @mrvonhofen
- 👀 I’m interested in colaborating on projects to expand my .NET framework know-how!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack development with Tech Elevator
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!
- 📫 Hollar at me on linkedIn. https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrvonhofen/

- If your here to check out my work - these are not the droid's you are looking for!
- I believe in delivering packagable content. None of my original ideas are ready for you. 
- With that said - I do a lot of practice over at CodeWars! https://www.codewars.com/users/mrvonhofen/completed_solutions
